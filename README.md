# CalcMaster

## How it works?

- Using the button below, the user can fetch random values from the backend.
- The user can calculate the total by manually entering the quantity or price.
- Profit is just to mention; it remains the same.
- If the user manipulates the total or profit, it does not change the other fields.
- The random values do not calculate the total; it only happens when the user does it manually.
